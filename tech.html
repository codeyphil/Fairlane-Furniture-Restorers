        <p>Similar to your experience with Google when seeking information, what once required sifting through file folders, has now been replaced with the convenient search feature when looking for various items in a given inventory. We can now discover a whole variety of information all in one single centralized place, that can be located from anywhere on the planet, from any device with an internet connection. Whether it be the cleaning status of an item, that item's location, what room the item was removed from within the home, who last moved the item, pre-existing conditions of the item prior to pickup, as well as a potentially infinite number of photographs that can be taken to properly document each item. Access to such a plethora of data enables us to be more transparent, and to be better equipped to serve our customers in an unprecedented manner.</p>

        <p>Contents inventories are now generated using a tablet or a smart phone. The description of the item, pre-existing condition notes, codes indicating what is to be done with the item, photographs of the item and more can be inputted into the device and uploaded into a central cloud database. This information is all contained and accessible within QR codes<span class="small-qr-code" alt="A small QR code image that accompanies the reference in the paragraph."><img src="qr-code-small.jpg"></span> and ID #'s that are then attached to each item to be used for tracking purposes, and to update the various details of the item as it moves from place to place throughout the restoration process. No longer is there an issue with numerical orders on the inventory or keeping track of physical pieces of paper to inform us about the contents; freeing us a little more from the bounds of the physical world.</p>

          <p>Everyone benefits when the time it takes to process the details and documentation of a claim is reduced. The people who benefit the most, however, are the insurance policyholders. No longer having to depend on handwritten inventories and hand written pricing to generate estimates has drastically reduced the length of time that must pass between the creation of the contents inventory, and the transfer of that information into a ready to be submitted estimate. Wrists and pens have certainly been saved in this transition!</p>

        <h3><b><u>Export Inventories Directly Into Xactimate</u></b></h3>
        <p>Since the release of Xactimate, and the overall market acceptance of it as being the standard software for estimate generation throughout the insurance restoration industry, manually keying line items and price codes has been the only way to build and submit estimates. With the export feature found within <a href="http://www.xactware.com/en-us/solutions/packout/contentstrack/overview/" target="_blank">ContentsTrack</a>, inventories that were generated using a tablet or smart phone can be sent directly to Xactimate within minutes. Traveling with it are all of the item descriptions, notes, images, rooms, and price codes. Add a little tweaking here and there, and the estimate is complete. This feature alone has really assisted us in fine tuning our efficiency, and hastens our ability to provide adjusters with the documents they need to process the claim. As a result, we are able to contribute towards shortening the time insured's must live outside of their normal life flow.</p>

        <h3><b><u>Capturing Total Loss Contents - From Tablet To Spreadsheet In Minutes</u></b></h3>
        <p>It is widely accepted that there are really only three ways to capture and generate a total loss contents inventory. The go to options are between handwriting the inventory and transcribing it, voice recording the inventory and transcribing it, or photographing the inventory. However, there is a fourth option that encompasses any and all of the processes in one. With software, the inventory can be captured and photographed on a tablet or smart phone, and can then be uploaded to the cloud database to be then exported into an Excel spreadsheet. There is no typing necessary beyond what is done on the tablet; so no double entry needed. This spreadsheet contains all descriptions, room information, quantities, and ages where applicable. At that point, it is ready to be presented to the insured for continued aging and pricing.</p>
      <hr id="ct-small-line">
      <p>With many insurance companies utilizing <a href="http://www.xactware.com/en-us/solutions/contents-estimating/xactcontents/overview/" target="_blank">Xactcontents</a> for the purposes of finding replacement cost values for total loss contents, we also have the ability to export total loss inventories directly into another Xactcontents instance. We simply need the Xactnet address associated with the Xactimate account we are sending the inventory to, and the inventory can be downloaded by the receiver and added to their current projects list to be priced. Again, the inconvenience of typing is bypassed.
