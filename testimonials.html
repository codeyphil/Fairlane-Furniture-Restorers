Your staff was terrific. They all conducted themselves professionally and were responsive to our requests. We appreciate that. It is not often that we could recommend a company with no hesitation, but in this case we are happy to recommend Fairlane Furniture Restorers for such dependable reassurance in our disastrous and long drawn-out water damaged dwelling. Your fine employees (and management) eased the pain. Also, the furniture that was refinished looks wonderful. Your refinisher did an outstanding job. We are very pleased with the refinished pieces. Thank you."<br><span class="test-reference">- E.P. --- Beverly Hills, MI</span></p>

Your ladies could not have been more efficient in their work and consideration of my dilemma. It is refreshing to see there are still people who are willing to work so hard and under such demanding weather conditions. They treated my property with sensitivity and care. One of your ladies uncovered some of my deceased wife's lost jewelry and her honesty in bringing it to my attention was appreciated. The lead lady kept me well informed and consulted with me on a daily basis. I would recommend you folks to anyone who is unfortunate enough to experience a similar disaster."<br><span class="test-reference">- R.K. --- Brighton, MI</span></p>

A special thank you to the person that did the refinishing and repair of my antique dining room set. It is great workmanship. I am very happy. To the two young men that picked up my furniture and then returned it - they handled it with so much care and respect. I could not be more pleased. They were wonderful. To the young ladies that packed and unpacked my belongings - they also handled my things with care and respect. They are a real asset to your company. Great gals all around. To the office staff - always kind and helpful. It was great to have them help me along the way.<br>I thank you all and wish for your good health, happiness and many many years of blessings"<br><span class="test-reference">- P.M. --- Woodhaven, MI</span></p>

				<p><span class="star"><img src="blue-reference-star.jpg" alt="Image of a small blue star."></span>"I recently used your company for some work at my house. I have worked in customer service for many years, and I think it is important to take time out and commend someone when you feel that they did a superb job. Yesterday, a crew of 3 men moved all of my belongings from the garage to my basement. They were polite, professionaly and were very efficient. Unfortunately, today I was not able to be there when the ladies did the set up of my items. My 88 year old blind father was home. He told me he offered them coffee. They declined and asked if there was anything they could do for him. He of course declined, but I cannot express enough how wonderful I found their offer to be. They did not have to do that. He told me how nice they were and how hard they worked. For that I thank you. Prior to this flood, I had no idea a service like your company even existed. I cannot begin to tell you how much pressure they took off of me. What they did yesterday and today would have taken me a month at least. It is so appreciated and I will without a doubt let others know of Fairlane Furniture Restorers."<span class="test-reference">- M.B. --- Garden City, MI</span></p>

            <p><span class="star"><img src="reference-star.jpg" alt="Image of a small gold star."></span>"Dear Fairlane Furniture Restorers<br><br>On June 18th, we had to leave our home because of a fire in the garage next door. This day was one of my worst in 69 years. The day it happened, in came an amazing company that packed up all of my precious things and took special care of my furniture. They cleaned and took care of all of our belongings for 6 months. The day of the fire, I was so very upset, and in comes an angel - your sales person. She put me in a calmed place, with her wonderful smile and heart. What a caring lady!<br><br>Well, six months later, our things are ready to come back, and here again is the wonderful team from Fairlane. The whole team came in and were all polite, and again, treated our things that we worked hard for with great care. We have such respect for the whole group.<br><br>At this part of my letter, I want to thank all of the members of the crew that were out at my home for protecting our floors, for moving all of the furniture in as well as the 400+ boxes :(. I also want to thank the girly girls for helping unpack some of those 400 boxes, and again for treating all of my little special things like they were worth a million. As I look back on the terrible time we went through, the one shining part was meeting and getting to know the team from Fairlane Furniture Restorers.<br>God Bless."<br><span class="test-reference">- R.H. --- Northville, MI</span></p>
